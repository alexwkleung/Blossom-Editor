# Attributions

**1)** The terminal is based off of [77Z](https://github.com/77Z/electron-local-terminal-prototype)'s electron-local-terminal-prototype project.

I tweaked the implementation to make it work with the current versions of Electron, Node.js, and TypeScript for this project. Other small modifications have also been done.
