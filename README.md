# Blossom Editor

![Blossom Editor](https://img.shields.io/badge/Blossom%20Editor-1.0.0-ff69b4) ![Platforms](https://img.shields.io/badge/Platforms-MacOS-lightgrey) ![Architecture](https://img.shields.io/badge/Architecture-x64-lightgrey) ![Signed](https://img.shields.io/badge/Code%20Signed-No-critical)

Blossom Editor is a 2000s era inspired text-editor with a slight modern touch. 

This text-editor is seen as a subsitute for your built-in notepad app, doing quick code edits, or basic markdown writing. In short, think of this as a mini complement to your daily text-editor or IDE when you want to do miniscule things. 

**Created with:**

- Languages: TypeScript, JavaScript

- Framework: Electron

- Editor: CodeMirror 

- Terminal/Pseudoterminal: xterm.js, node-pty

- Markdown Parser: Marked

- Other: exec-sh, typescript-compile

- Icon: Twemoji 14.0 - Cherry Blossom

# Warnings

**1)** You'll be packaging the application, creating the `.dmg`, and installing it yourself. This application is not code signed, so beware of any vulnerabilities or issues that may arise upon installation.

**2)** Due to the lack of a proper load, save, file explorer, and other features, this SHOULD NOT be used in a professional or in a serious workflow of any sort. 

**3)** You are liable for any file loss or damage. Keep in mind that this is a proof-of-concept and experimental project, so nothing about this is perfect in any way shape or form compared to current day text-editors. Also, everyone has different use cases. While this may work well for others, it may not work for you.

**3)** There might be slight performance issues since I haven't done any proper optimizations. Expect variable RAM usage and fans to kick in depending on your system specs.

# Installation

# Contributions

Your contributions are welcomed. Blossom Editor definitely could become more usable and stable for daily use once the core issues are sorted out.
