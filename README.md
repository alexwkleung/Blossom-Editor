# Blossom Editor

Blossom Editor is a 2000s era inspired text-editor with a slight modern touch. 

This text-editor is seen as a subsitute for your built-in notepad app, doing quick code edits, or basic markdown writing. In short, think of this as a mini complement to your daily text-editor or IDE when you want to do miniscule things. 

**Created with:**

- Languages: TypeScript, JavaScript

- Framework: Electron

- Editor: CodeMirror 

- Terminal/Pseudoterminal: xterm.js, node-pty

- Markdown Parser: Marked

- Other: exec-sh, typescript-compile

- Icon: Twemoji 14.0 - Cherry Blossom

# Why 

This project was created as a small appreciation with a slight modern touch for usability and feel. I hope some would enjoy this for whatever reason.

It isn't perfect but it works decently well in my opinion.

The 2000s era was a time that had many emerging technologies (both hardware and software) that people had never seen or used before. These times gave a hint of "realistically moving to an ever growing technological world". The growth of some of those technologies heavily sprouted strong into the 2010s+ and are now a vital piece in our daily lives. Appreciating the 2000s era for bringing those technologies to a new start of a "modern" world - surpassing the past era's, was a huge leap in cutting-edge and bleeding-edge technology that I sometimes cannot believe has happened. Whether or not this was a blessing or a curse, we would have to accept the outcome no matter what.

I am a little biased here as you can tell. However the points are somewhat reasonable but not 100% agreeable in my opinion. I'm not trying to look down on any era of technological advancement since they are all very important to the current day. I mainly wanted to point out the era that *I believe* showed people that the unknowns of cutting-edge technologies were here to stay and improve our lives. Thus, with time, we saw that it worked out somewhat well if we think about the positive side of it.

While this text-editor may seem more modern instead of a 2000s era inspired application, I tried to balance it as best as I could.

# Warnings

**1)** You'll be packaging the application, creating the `.dmg`, and installing it yourself. This application is not code signed, so beware of any vulnerabilities or issues that may arise.

**2)** Due to the lack of a proper load, save, file explorer, and other features, this SHOULD NOT be used in a professional or in a serious workflow of any sort. 

**3)** You are liable for any file loss or damage. Keep in mind that this is a proof-of-concept and experimental project, so nothing about this is perfect in any way shape or form compared to current day text-editors. Also, everyone has different use cases. While this may work for others, it may not work for you.

**3)** There may be slight performance issues due to the app being a little heavy. I'll work, no doubt, but be prepared for those fans to kick in.

# Installation

# Contributions

Your contributions are welcomed. Blossom Editor definitely could become more usable and stable for daily use once the core issues are sorted out.
