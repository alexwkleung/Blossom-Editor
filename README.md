- Terminal/Pseudoterminal: xterm.js, node-pty

- Markdown Parser: Marked

- Other: exec-sh, typescript-compile

- Icon: Twemoji 14.0 - Cherry Blossom

# Why 

I believe that the 2000s era was the most influential and memorable timeframe in terms of technology. Now of course that's just a simplification of the gist. All sorts of usable/reasonable advancements being pushed to the mainstream, making lives easier compared to the previous era's is something that some of us don't appreciate enough in the current era. 

Created in the mind of a small appreciation project with a slight modern touch for usability, I hope that some would enjoy this.

This text-editor is seen as a subsitute for your built-in notepad app, doing quick code edits, or basic markdown writing. In short, think of this as a mini complement to your daily text-editor or IDE when you want to do miniscule things. 

It isn't perfect but it function decently well in my (biased) opinion.

# Installation

# Warnings

**1)** Since you'll be packaging the application yourself and running it, there will be no signature. 

Due to the lack of a proper load, save, file manager/explorer, and other factors, this SHOULD NOT be used in a professional or in a serious workflow of any sort. 

You are liable for any file loss or damage. Keep in mind that since this is a proof-of-concept and experimental, nothing about this is perfect in any way shape or form compared to current day text-editors. Everyone has different use cases. While this may work for others, it may not work for you.

# Contributions

Your contributions are welcomed. I am certain that Blossom Editor could become more usable and stable for daily use once the core issues are sorted out. 

If you have any problems, submit an issue. You may also talk about anything regarding the project in the dicussions tab.
